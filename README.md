Project Target: To solve the kinetic problems in triplet triplet annihilation.

Mathematical Model:
Supposed that the excitation is instant and the triplet energy transfer is fast and efficient.
The TTA of annihalotors can be described by:
p[T]/pt=D*Delta[T]-k2[T]^2-k1[T]

Steady state condition: Delta[T]=0

Initial Condition: [T]0=A*I
